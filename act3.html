    <div class="whyronaldoistheGOAT">
        <p> Cristiano Ronaldo is considered the GOAT because of his extraordinary combination of talent, hard work, and consistency.
        He has scored over 850 career goals across multiple top leagues, proving he can dominate anywhere, and he has repeatedly
        delivered in the biggest moments, like Champions League finals and crucial international matches. Beyond natural skill,
        his dedication to training, fitness, and constantly improving himself sets him apart from almost every player in
        history. Ronaldo’s versatility, ability to score with both feet, his head, and from long range, along with numerous
        records and awards, make him not just a great player, but a true football legend who inspires millions around the world. </p>

    <div class="whymessisucks">
        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is often considered better than Messi because he thrives in every league he plays in, whereas Messi
        spent most of his peak career at Barcelona. Ronaldo is physically dominant—strong, fast, and amazing in the air—while
        Messi relies more on dribbling in tight spaces. Ronaldo also scores more goals in the Champions League, showing he
        performs in the biggest international club matches. Off the field, Ronaldo’s work ethic, dedication, and discipline are
        legendary, making him a role model for aspiring players, whereas Messi is more naturally gifted and sometimes seen as
        less versatile. In short, Ronaldo combines talent, power, and mental strength, which some fans argue makes him the more
        complete player.</p>
